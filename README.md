# Obsidian Filename Kebab

Obsidian plugin to automatically change filenames in your vault to `kebab-case`. 

You may want to use `kebab-case` for filenames because:
1. It makes it easier to work with files in the terminal/shell than using filenames with spaces.
1. It's broadly inter-operable across filesystems.

With this plugin Obsidian's filenames will always be converted to `kebab-case`!
